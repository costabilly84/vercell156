                Does a new or leased car need gap insurance? Gap insurance pays for the difference between the value of a car at the time it&#039;s totaled or stolen and the balance of its loan or lease. Gap insurance can be useful, but only for people who owe significantly more on their car loan or lease than the car is currently worth.

    <h3>Gap insurance protects you when you make an insurance claim and receive a payout that&#039;s less than the cost or value of the car when you bought it.</h3>
